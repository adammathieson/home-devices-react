Scene 1

Setting:  A neighborhood in a suburb — houses in the background

A delivery person walks along a path carrying a medium sized box with both hands to the front porch of a large blue house and stops at the front steps.

Up above the front door is a mounted camera.

[ The view zooms in on a small, white,  wall-mounted camera — product information appears next to the camera that reads: ]

[ The view zooms back out to show the delivery person and porch and then fades to black ]

Scene 2
Setting: interior of a small home office

A person sits typing at their computer

[ The view zooms in on another small camera, though different from the one on the front porch, it’s clearly made by the same company. Text displays reading: ] 

Wyze Cam Pan

1080p Full HD
	[ $29.99 ] twenty-nine ninety-nine

[ View zooms out and pans down to person on their computer — zooms in tight to the monitor. ]

A job application form is filled out — when the resume attachment uploads the form auto-fills with the information of the applicant.

A small rectangular and bright green alert box slides in from the top right corner of the monito that reads “Motion alert at front door cam…”. 

The mouse cursor moves over the alert message and clicks causing the thicker outer border of the box to appear in an even brighter shade of green before dissolving away.

An application window opens showing the feed from the front door camera.

The mouse cursor moves over a lock icon on right side menu of the interface and as it clicks, the the word “Locked” — just above the icon — turns to “Unlocked”.

[ Fade out to black ]

Scene 3
Setting: Interior of the front entry way of the house

[ View zooms in on the backside of the front door to a sleek light grey lock. Text displays reading: ]

Wyze Lock
Remote Access
Auto lock/unlock
	[ $99.99 ] ninety-nine ninety-nine

The turn knob (dial) on the lock moves from a flat horizontal position to straight up while small green light slowly blinks.

[ View zooms back out ]

The front door swings open and delivery person enters carrying box towards a thin table just inside the entry way.

Without stopping the delivery person slides the package onto the table and then turns to walk out and closes the door behind them.

[ Fade out to black ]

Scene 4 
Setting: interior of a small home office

The person sitting at the computer closes the camera feed application window, spins in their chair, and slides backwards off the screen with their arms raised, and their legs flailing with excitement. 

[ Fade out to black ]

Scene 5
Setting: Interior of the front entry way of the house

The person slides in on the office chair and when they are in line with the table and package (in one motion) they stand up out of the chair (the chair continues to slide out of screens viewport) and lift the contents from the now open top flap of the box and into to air showing — in each hand respectfully — a slightly beefier camera and accompanying base antenna unit. 

[ View zooms into the camera and base. Text displays reading: ]

Wyze Cam Outdoor
Wireless livestream & recording
6 month battery charge
	[ $49.99 ] forty-nine ninety-nine

[ View zooms out to the person leap sinto the air with outstretched arms still holding the new camera unit ]

At the apex of leap the image freeze-frames and in large white title lettering the word “WYZE” (and logo of the company) displays across the entire screen.

A button with words “Play Again” pops up to the bottom of the page.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
